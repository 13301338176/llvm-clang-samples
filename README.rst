LLVM & Clang library usage samples
==================================

This is a work in progress. Nothing to see here yet.

Running tests and tools
-----------------------

This is not really necessary to study the examples. The tests allow me to make
sure the examples keep working as LLVM advances. For running the tests and
auxiliary tools (and any other Python scripts in this repo), Python version 3.3+
is required.
